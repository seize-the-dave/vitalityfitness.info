Personal trainer Sports massage therapist in Cardiff

My name is Donna and I have a real passion for fitness and healthy living. I’ve been a personal trainer in Cardiff since 2004 & a Sports Massage Therapist in Cardiff since 2008.

I educate you through every aspect of the session so you come away with a greater understanding of your body and how you are helping yourself to achieve your goals. I guide you through the my fun and diverse sessions so they  feel like a real journey. I provide nutritional and health related advice to get you to where you want to be, faster.

As a keen sports woman throughout my life I’ve always been extremely interested in training, sport and fitness. I have competed for Cornwall in Cross Country running and more recently my favourite sport would have to be mountain biking. I love the exhilaration of the sport, as well as the challenge! I am a keen runner and try to train regularly.

When I travelled the world, I decided that I wanted to become a [Personal Trainer Sports & Massage Therapist in Cardiff](/personal-trainer-cardiff) and help others achieve their fitness goals. I made a significant realisation that I loved helping people to feel good and so I coupled my love of exercise with this realisation and retrained as a Personal Trainer and Sports Massage Therapist.

I set up Vitality Fitness and have completed a Boxercise course, sports massage diploma, kettlebell, Exercise for children and more course since to compliment my personal training.

I am a fully qualified Level 3 Personal Trainer having previously completed Level 2 Gym Instruction courses. My Level 4 Diploma in Sports Massage means that I have a high level of understanding of the human body and how it works.

I am very happily married and am lucky to have two daughters  who have inspired me to gain a qualification in teaching exercise to children as I find it even more rewarding working with children (which I did not think was possible!)

Although life is very different since having children I still try to train as regularly as possible and keep in shape. Of course, this is a challenge sometimes, but I always do my best. That is all any one of us can do.

I am also qualified to work with pre- and post-natal women. I loved being pregnant both times and I honestly think this was partly down to exercising regularly and staying healthy. After an emergency C section with my first daughter I was keen for a natural birth for my second baby. I learnt techniques and positions that help, up to and during, labour and it is a real passion for me to be able to pass on this information and allow women to believe in their bodies through safe positions and exercises. I believed in my own body and had a most wonderful & beautiful water birth with my second daughter.

I hold “Public Indemnity” and “Civil Liability” insurance cover.
