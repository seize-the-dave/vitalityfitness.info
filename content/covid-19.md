Hi all,

Although, at the moment, we are able to meet outside for PT sessions some people are preferring to continue with their sessions via either WhatsApp or Zoom. I have been both surprised and pleased at how well the sessions are going over video. Although, it will never be the same as in person, we are able to work out to a high level, whilst maintaining some contact with each other and enjoying ourselves. I've found the sessions are really helping me through this pandemic as it's a regular meet, catch up and work out all at the same time! 
Many people are looking for ideas and motivation during this time and I think that a weekly session not only helps physically, but also mentally. We are being forced to be less social so some contact via a video is a real pick me up and I can get your heart raised whilst sculpting your muscles, all at the same time!

If you are interested in some personal training over video then please get in contact.

Itâ€™s important we are both totally comfortable with working over a video, so to help with this I can provide a free consultation over video before we begin. This will help us both to feel confident about working with each other, allow me to find out your main goals and help to overcome any anxieties with regards to the software we are using, or indeed anything at all! 

Family exercise video sessions also available.

Call me for an informal chat on <a href="tel:+442920140069">029 2014 0069</a> / <a href="tel:+447904525169">079 0452 5169</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:donna@vitalityfitness.info">donna@vitalityfitness.info</a>.

In the meantime, stay safe.

Donna
